I created this project after teaching myself a few basic React concepts. This app uses [Semantic UI React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) as a UI library. Much of the functionality is assisted by the use of Firebase, from which I use Firestore and Google OAuth.

I have implemented the workflow of a simple retail site, from which you can add Pok√©mon cards to your cart. Each card has an attached forum, where you can leave reviews on the card. When you're done, you can check out your purchase using Stripe.

This project is hosted using Heroku and can be found [here](https://gregorytcheng-pokeshop.herokuapp.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
